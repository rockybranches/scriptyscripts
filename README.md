## About

This version of `scriptyscripts` is a public fork of the custom toolkit that I developed organically out of necessity.

It's intentionally boilerplate.

Not sure yet how much I'll be working on this-- please indicate your interest by *star*-ing the project, or open an issue if you want to discuss something specific.

Hope this toolkit improves your quality of life. `<3`
